Surprise!

All of the styles are actually located in style-active.css ,
registered and enqueued by the function tutv_styles() in lib/init.php .

This is mainly for the sake of compression and due to CodeKit's
output style restrictions. In order to leave the above Wordpress
child theme comment intact, CodeKit's business must be taken elsewhere.
I may consider revising in later versions, but for now it will do.

The main stylesheet is complied using SASS/SCSS and CodeKit.
If that doesn't make sense, please look into SASS - it's a great
expansion on the capabilities of CSS. CodeKit isn't necessary,
as there are command-line tools and some other GUI tools that can
compile SASS/SCSS, but CodeKit is by far the simplest way of doing it.

Surprise!

All of the styles are actually located in /style-active.css ,
registered and enqueued by the function tutv_styles() in /library/init.php .

This is mainly for the sake of compression and due to CodeKit's
output style restrictions. I may consider revising
in later versions, but for now it will do.

The main stylesheet is complied using SASS/SCSS and CodeKit.
If that doesn't make sense, please look into SASS - it's a great
expansion on the capabilities of CSS. CodeKit isn't necessary,
as there are command-line tools and some other GUI tools that can
compile SASS/SCSS, but CodeKit is by far the simplest way of doing it.
